            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Honestly, all of these books sound boring to me. I know what I want to read.
                There's a newer Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn. Now that guy knows how to write the good stuff.
                I hope I do not get into trouble writing this. I am sorry Mr. Brown, Mr. Roediger, and Mr. McDaniel!

                <p>Here are 6 quick sentences. Wow, I messed up my grammar on the previous paragraph trying to rush
                    through it.
                    You live and learn, I guess. This is actually pretty fun.
                    HackReactor is the best. My instructors are so smart.
